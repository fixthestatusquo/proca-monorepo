# Development setup

Proca backend is an Elixir app that uses PostgreSQL as data store and RabbitMQ
for data processing. The PostgreSQL is managed by migrations. The RabbitMQ is
(re)configured live when the app is run, it only needs predentials to access it.

1. Databases: create

```
sudo -i
su postgres
createuser -P proca
# input "proca" as password
createdb -O proca proca
createdb -O proca proca_test
exit
```

3. Databases: initialize
```
mix ecto.migrate
mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
# same for test db
env MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.migrate
env MIX_ENV=test  mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
```

3. Create RabbitMQ

```
./utils/create-queue
sudo -i
echo "172.19.0.3  rabbitmq.docker" >> /etc/hosts
# add proca user and proca vhost
./utils/create-queue-creds
```

Login to http://rabbitmq.docker:15672/ with guest/guest and add:
- virtual host called "proca" (not "/proca")
- user called proca (pass proca) with full access to virtual host "proca"

Test vhost: we do not use a test vhost at this point. The test run uses the same
dev one (should be moved to test one at some point, or queue messaging mocked
out).

4. Run the app

```
mix deps.get
mix phx.server
```
