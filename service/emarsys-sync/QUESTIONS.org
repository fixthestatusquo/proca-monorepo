 By default, the key is the email address with field identifier 3. The external identifier and the key can be the same or different fields.

However, it is best practice to assign a unique identifier to your contacts for mapping between our ecosystems using a custom field named externalId

** optin value
1. user clicks no  on the form: optin = FALSE
2. user cliks yes on the form: optin = null (not set) - because we wait for email opt in 
3. use clicks the link in the email: optin = TRUE
4. proca receives info that users email bounces/user marks as as spam in Gmail etc: optin = FALSE (don't make them more angry).

Does this mean that we still want to complete the DOI process for point 2 from Emarsys? Should we think of it that way?
